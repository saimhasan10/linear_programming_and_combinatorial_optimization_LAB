## Questions 

1. Vertical Constraints:
    Problem Statement: Plot the line x = 4 and shade the region where x <= 4.

2. Horizontal Constraints:
    Problem Statement: Plot the line y = 3 and shade the region where y <= 3.

3. Constraints & Inequalities
    Problem Statement: Plot the line 5x + 4y = 20 and shade the region where 5x + 4y <= 20

4. Constraints Involving Fractions
    Problem Statement: Plot the line (1/2)x + (2/3)y = 4 and shade the region 
    where (1/2)x + (2/3)y <= 4.

5. Constraints with Decimal Points
    Problem Statement: Plot the line 0.5x + 0.25y = 2.5 and shade the region 
    where 0.5x + 0.25y <= 2.5.

6. Constraints with Negative Coefficients

7. Constraints with Zero in RHS
    Problem Statement: Plot the line 3x - 4y = 0 and shade the region where 3x - 4y <= 0.

8. Equality Constraints
    Problem Statement: Plot the line 2x + y = 6 and indicate the exact line without shading, as this represents an equality
